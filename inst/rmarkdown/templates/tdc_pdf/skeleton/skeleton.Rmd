# My first heading
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## My second heading    
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
  
## This is a level 2 heading    
```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:
  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This is a list:

* one
* two
* three

```{r}
library(magrittr)
library(huxtable)
ht <- hux(
        Employee = c('John Smith', 'Jane Doe', 'David Hugh-Jones'),
        Salary = c(50000, 50000, 40000),
        add_colnames = TRUE
      )

ht                                        %>%
      set_bold(1, everywhere, TRUE)       %>%
      set_bottom_border(1, everywhere, 1)
```

```{r}
